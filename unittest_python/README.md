Python Unit Testing
===================

Python unit testing examples/templates for getting started in new/existing projects.

## Description

There are many good reasons to include unit tests in a project. Two being, test driven development and portability.

Test driven development serves a way of meeting goals/requirements for a project. By scaffolding tests before coding, development can proceed to meet the test requirements and keep in mind future tests to complete. As well as providing evidence that as development continues, nothing changes/breaks along the way. 

Portability is made easier by providing future developers another piece of documentation through these tests and insight into what to expect of capabilities. As well as assurance that features function as expected while refactoring or new development is underway.

The unittest package is included in pythons standard library and a good solution when packages are not accessible for download. Additional package examples here are offered as options to meet developer preferences or project capability. The example folders will look like tutorials for the frameworks, but also functional examples. In this way the unittest can be adapted or used as guidance for new/future projects.

Running unit tests manually while developing a project is great, but for poduction environments testing should move to be run using continuous integration frameworks. More on this to come.

## Frameworks included

* [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Frameworks to be included

* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
* [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2), because [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is not going to be maintained much longer.
* [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest)

There are however, many many more [options](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy)
